Random forest and linear regreions models on the 24-25 NBA season

## Requirements

Python 3.10+

import pandas as pd

import seaborn as sns

import numpy as np

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Usage

Must contain specific CSV file within the same directory as the scripts

Simply complie the script to see the ppg before and after the prediction models as well as MSE and r^2 values for both prediction models
